## Introduction 
The purpose of this relocation helper Data Analytics project is to help guide individuals through the process of relocation by providing insights into economic factors influencing their decision to relocate within the US.

This dataset contains almost 100K rows of Economic data by US state and county. It's from the Bureau of Economic Analysis -> https://bea.gov
