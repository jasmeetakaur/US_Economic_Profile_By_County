# Relocation Helper

## Introduction 
The purpose of this relocation helper Data Analytics project is to help guide individuals through the process of relocation by providing insights into economic factors influencing their decision to relocate within the US.

## Dataset details 
For the purpose of this project, I have used the [US Economic Profile by County 1969-2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidbroberts/us-economic-profile-by-county) dataset. This dataset contains almost 100K rows of Economic data by US state and county. It's from the Bureau of Economic Analysis -> https://bea.gov

The data covers 32 economic categories like Personal Income, Unemployment Insurance Compensation, Net Earnings etc.
